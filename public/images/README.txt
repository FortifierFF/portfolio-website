Game Preview Images

The following image files are used for game previews:

1. memory-match.jpg - Memory Match game preview image
2. 2048.png - 2048 game preview image
3. color-guess.webp - Color Guess game preview image
4. math-challenge.webp - Math Challenge game preview image

These images are used in the game cards on the mini-games section of the portfolio.

For the Word Puzzle (which is marked as "Coming Soon"), a colored placeholder is automatically generated based on the game title.

These images should be in 16:9 aspect ratio, with a minimum resolution of 400x225 pixels for best display quality.

Until these images are created, placeholder colors will be shown in place of game previews.
